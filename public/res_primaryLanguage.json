Leveraging prior project experiences, I grasped the efficiencies of React, simplifying complex coding tasks. Exploring React unveiled its simplicity and efficiency, enhancing my understanding of web development practices. I implemented interactive card displays, where user interaction would reveal individual details. Additionally, I incorporated filtering functionality based on the number of horns each beast possessed.",
